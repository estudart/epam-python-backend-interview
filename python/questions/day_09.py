Q1. What is an abstract class, and how does it differ from other classes in 
object-oriented programming?

An abstract class is an object-oriented programming construct that enables 
developers to create a base or parent class from which other child classes 
may inherit specific attributes and methods. Unlike regular classes, the 
members of an abstract class cannot be instantiated and are typically used 
as templates containing generic implementation details for use by its 
derived subclasses.
"""

"""
Q3. How do you define a programming language as dynamic rather than static?
A programming language is said to be dynamic when a program can be modified 
during its running and can modify other components at runtime, avoiding the 
need for recompiling or redeploying an application every time changes are made.

This eliminates static languages requiring data types of variables to be 
declared beforehand for everything else within that codebase environment 
surrounding it globally, from usability testing implications involving 
interactive experimentation processes accordingly.
"""

"""
Q5. What are some key features that characterize object-oriented programming?
Key features of Object-Oriented Programming:

Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
Benefits include increasing code abstraction modularity, enhanced reusability 
of classes, and customized user implementation.
Wide range of applications across software development domains, from usability 
testing to interactive implementations in practical, real-world scenarios. 
Continuous perpetuity as usage continues to grow with more advanced technology.
"""

"""
Q6 . What is an abstract method, and when would it typically be used during 
software development projects utilizing OOP principles?

An abstract method is a declaration found only in classes defined as abstract, 
meaning they cannot be instantiated. These methods have no implementation details 
and can, therefore, not be called directly from outside code. Child classes must 
inherit the definitions and provide suitable implementations for each case scenario 
contextually encountered within real-world usage scenarios. 

This process continues on an ever-evolving journey of universal perpetuity, visible 
today through multiple application landscapes involving interactive user experiences.

Q11. How can real-life examples be incorporated into developing solutions with 
EPAM Systems?

Real-life examples can be incorporated into EPAM System projects using various methods 
such as analogies or case studies demonstrating how similar problems have been solved 
successfully for other organizations working with related technologies/solutions on 
multiple platforms (i.,e mobile applications).

Such examples provide valuable insights on what works well within specific contexts 
and also help identify potential pain points before they become issues further down 
the line, saving both money & effort spent trying to fix them later on if found out 
too late.
"""

"""
Q17. What is a class abstract, and how does it relate to the default constructors of 
a program/application?

In object-oriented programming, an abstract class is a class that cannot be 
instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes and defines common 
attributes and behaviors that its subclasses can inherit and implement. An abstract 
class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.

The concept of abstract classes and default constructors is not directly related. An 
abstract class can have constructors, including default constructors, just like any 
other class. The presence or absence of a default constructor in an abstract class 
does not have a specific relationship with the abstractness of the class itself. 
Default constructors are more closely related to the instantiation of classes, 
providing a way to create objects without actually specifying constructor arguments.
