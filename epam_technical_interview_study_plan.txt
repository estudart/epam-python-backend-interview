- 📘 Study:
  - Time complexity (Big-O)
  - Common patterns (two pointers, sliding window)
- 🔗 Practice:
  - [LeetCode Easy Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=Easy)
  - Pick 3–5 problems (e.g., Two Sum, Contains Duplicate)

---

### 📅 Day 3: Algorithms Part 2 + Coding
- 🧠 Focus: Sorting, Recursion, Greedy, Binary Search
- 🔗 Practice:
  - [LeetCode Medium](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/?difficulty=Medium)
  - Practice at least 3 real-time problems
- 🧪 Simulate one timed 30-minute coding test (use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to draw time/space analysis)

---

### 📅 Day 4: Python & Bash Skills
- 🧠 Python: list comprehensions, dict manipulation, file I/O, exceptions, decorators
- 🧪 Bash:
  - File manipulation
  - Looping
  - Environment variables
- Practice:
  - Write 3 Python functions from scratch
  - Write 2 Bash scripts (e.g., log parser, env config)

---

### 📅 Day 5: CI/CD and AWS Tools
- 🔧 Review:
  - **CI/CD Tools**: Jenkins basics, GitHub Actions, Bamboo if possible
  - **AWS**: IAM, Lambda, S3, EC2, CloudFormation vs Terraform vs CDK
- Watch:
  - [AWS CloudFormation Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E11bYkWz4eI)
  - [CI/CD Pipeline Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hHMwLxN6EM)

---

### 📅 Day 6: System Design + Self-Service Platform Concepts
- Study:
  - SDLC (full pipeline: code → test → deploy)
  - Platform Engineering Principles
- Prep 1–2 examples of self-service tools you've built
- Review:
  - Docker basics: image, container, Dockerfile
  - Kubernetes architecture (high-level only)

---

### 📅 Day 7: Mock Interview + Review
- 🔁 Review notes and tricky topics
- 🤝 Ask a friend to do a 45-minute mock interview
- 🧘‍♂️ Practice introducing yourself clearly:
  - Your role
  - Key projects
  - Where you used AWS, CI/CD, Python, Bash

---

## 📌 Bonus Tips

- Have a few **stories** ready using the **STAR format**:
  - Situation, Task, Action, Result
- Prepare 2–3 questions for your interviewer
- Keep your environment ready: good internet, working mic + camera, no distractions
